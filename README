Haystack: The compuational chemistry notebook
------------------------

Quantum chemistry inside an IPython notebook.

Based on the atomic simulaton environment for constructon of ab-initio calculations
JSMol for visualisaton
cclib for extracting data

Offers a local Gaussian calculator object that can send calculations to be executed remotely on a pbs-torque cluster

Install from anaconda via:

  conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/Clyde_Fare cc-notebook
  conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/Clyde_Fare gausspy
  cc_notebook_init

a .cc_notebook.ini file is created by the cc_notebook_init command and placed in your home directory.

Details particular to your setup need to be filled in.

The ase_home and ase_scratch directories need to be set to the directory the notebook server will be run in.
The gauss_home and gauss_scratch directories need to be set to the equivalent directory on the cluster

To run calculations remotely on a PBS server, Haystack must also be installed and initialised on the cluster.
The .cc_notebook.ini file on the cluster should have ase_home and ase_scratch set to the cluster's directories
(i.e. to the gauss_home and gauss_scratch values on the local machines .cc_notebook.ini file.
